# Fuzzing harness explain

The fuzzing harness skips the transport layer and directly initialises a `core_rpc_server` object. It then calls and fuzzes the RPC endpoint function handlers directly, removing the need to start a fake server while still allowing the handler logic for each RPC API to be fuzzed.


## `fuzz_rpc.cpp` / `fuzz_zmq.cpp`

These are the main fuzzing entry point, containing `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`, which manages each iteration of the fuzzing process.

## `initialisation.cpp` / `initialisation.h`

This set of source files provides initialisation helper functions to configure the `core_rpc_server` class with dummy protocols, P2P, payment modules, and other components. It also includes functions to generate fake random blocks, miners, and transactions for use in fuzzing.

## `rpc_endpoints.cpp` / `rpc_endpoints.h` / `zmq_endpoints.cpp` / `zmq_endpoints.h`

These source files handle the creation of the necessary request and response objects and the invocation of specific endpoint functions. These simulate real RPC requests / ZMQ requests for the purpose of fuzzing. There are three categories of RPC endpoint functions and only 1 for ZMQ endpoint functions:

* **Safe**: Considered stable and unlikely to fail.
* **Risky**: More prone to failure and early exits, especially if no valid blockchain is generated or no payment modules are configured.
* **Priority**: Most critical RPC endpoint functions that will at least run once per iteration.

# Building the Fuzzing Harnesses

The same `fuzz_rpc.cpp` is compiled into two versions of the fuzzer, one with the `SAFE` macro defined and one without. While the `fuzz_zmq` is compiled into a single version.

* With `SAFE` defined: Only safe endpoint functions are fuzzed.
* Without `SAFE`: Both safe and risky functions are included in the fuzzing process and payment modules are being configured.

# Fuzzing Harness Flow

## Select a Random RPC Endpoint Function / ZMQ Endpoint Function

Random data is used to generate selectors that choose an RPC endpoint function / ZMQ endpoint function to fuzz, either from the safe or risky function maps (depending on whether the `SAFE` macro is defined) and function from priority is always included at least once.


## `initialise_rpc_core` / `initialise_rpc_server`

At the start of each fuzzing iteration, a `core_rpc_server` object is created and initialised with dummy protocols, P2P, payment modules, and more.
If the `SAFE` macro is not defined, the payment module will also be initialised.
This step is skipped for `fuzz_zmq`.

## `generate_random_blocks`

The provided random data is used to initialise a set of random blocks, which are added to a dummy blockchain (initialised using `FAKECHAIN`).
If blocks are successfully added, a list of random transactions is then generated and also pushed to the blockchain.
This step is skipped for `fuzz_zmq`.

## Real Fuzzing

The selected RPC endpoint helper function in `rpc_endpoints` or `zmq_endpoints` generates a random request and response object for the specific call, and then invokes the corresponding handler in the `core_rpc_server` object.

## Timeout Handling

We use SIGALRM to catch and rewind timeout events in order to prevent the process from hanging, allowing the fuzzing to continue to the next iteration.
This approach may cause memory leaks, which are intentionally not checked during the fuzzing process.
